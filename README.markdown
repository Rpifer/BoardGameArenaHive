# Hive
This is an implementation of Hive the board game by John Yianni.
The overall purpose is to implement the full set of rules with a 
playable interface. Additionally, this allows the player to traverse
through gameplay history to replay moves and go through different timelines.

The ultimate goal is hook this up to BoardGameArena.com and use their web API
to load and play game from this application to theirs.
